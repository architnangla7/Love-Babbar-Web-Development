                    <p>March 2023-May 2023</p>
                    <p>The fundamental goal of our project, is to create a secure and user-friendly system for transmitting and handling credit card details over the Internet. This system aims to protect the sensitive credit card information from unauthorized access and ensure the accuracy of data being transmitted.
                        The project aims to achieve this by developing a secure mechanism for transmitting credit card details, encrypting the sensitive information using RSA, implementing the LUHN algorithm for validation and accuracy checks, and creating a user-friendly GUI interface for inputting and displaying the encrypted and decrypted information.</p>

                        Web Development Showcase: Building and Deploying a Static Website with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and AWS S3</h3>
                    <p>October 2022-November 2022</p>
                    <p>The project showcases the process of designing and developing a static website using front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, and subsequently deploying it on Amazon Web Services (AWS) using an S3 bucket.
                        The project begins with the creation of a visually appealing and user-friendly website using HTML for structuring the content, CSS for styling and layout, and Bootstrap for responsive design. The website is designed to provide a seamless browsing experience across different devices and screen sizes.
                        After the website development phase, the next step involves deploying the website on AWS using an S3 bucket. Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is a highly scalable cloud storage service provided by AWS. By leveraging S3, the website can be securely hosted and made accessible to users worldwide.
                        The deployment process includes setting up an S3 bucket, configuring the necessary permissions, and uploading the website's HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap files to the bucket. Once deployed, the website can be accessed through a unique URL provided by AWS.
                        Throughout the project, best practices for web development and AWS deployment are followed, ensuring efficient code organization, optimization, and security measures. The project aims to demonstrate the seamless integration of front-end web development technologies with AWS infrastructure, providing an end-to-end solution for building and hosting a website.</p>
